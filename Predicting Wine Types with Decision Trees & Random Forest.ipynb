    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a simple demonstration of how to use scikit-learn to build a Decision Tree model and Random Forest model for classification. It uses a dataset of 178 wines and their various attributes. There are three different classes of wine in the data and the goal is to predict the wine class based upon the attributes.\n",

    "## The Data\n",

    "Information on the data can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.names). The main thing we are going to focus on our the attribute names as the raw data doesn't have a header. The first column is the class, which is what we wish to predict, and the rest of the attributes we will use as features:\n",

    "The purpose of splitting the data is to be able to assess the quality of a predictive model when it is used on unseen data. When training, you will try to build a model that fits to the data as closely as possible, to be able to most accurately make a prediction. However, without a test set you run the risk of overfitting - the model works very well for the data it has seen but not for new data.\n",

You would use the training data to understand which classifier you wish to use; the validation set to test on whilst tweaking parameters; and the test set to get an understanding of how your final model would work in practice. Furthermore, there are techniques such as K-Fold cross validation that also help to reduce bias.\n",
