    "This notebook is a simple demonstration of how to use scikit-learn to build a Neural Network for classification. It uses a dataset of 178 wines and their various attributes.

When training, you will try to build a model that fits to the data as closely as possible, to be able to most accurately make a prediction.

Furthermore, there are techniques such as K-Fold cross validation that also help to reduce bias.\n",

    "## Neural Network Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on Neural Networks can be found in the scikit-learn documentation [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of parameters that can be tuned that should be explored when trying to improve Neural Network models. A common approach is to test many different parameters, building multiple models and testing their accuracy to find the best combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "For Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, the [scikit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier) provides parameters that can be passed by the user; changing these are likely to have an impact on the performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is high-level information on the parameters, the documentation has more details:\n",
    "- hidden_layer_sizes : default (100,)\n",
    "    - The ith element represents the number of neurons in the ith hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- activation : default ‘relu’\n",
    "    - Activation function for the hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- solver : default ‘adam’\n",
    "    - The solver for weight optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- alpha : default 0.0001\n",
    "    - L2 penalty (regularization term) parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- batch_size : default ‘auto’\n",
    "    - Size of minibatches for stochastic optimizers. If the solver is ‘lbfgs’, the classifier will not use minibatch. When set to “auto”, batch_size=min(200, n_samples)\n",
    "\n",
    "- learning_rate : default ‘constant’\n",
    "    - Learning rate schedule for weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- learning_rate_init : default 0.001\n",
    "    - The initial learning rate used. It controls the step-size in updating the weights. Only used when solver=’sgd’ or ‘adam’.\n",
    "\n",
    "- power_t : default 0.5\n",
    "    - The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate. It is used in updating effective learning rate when the learning_rate is set to ‘invscaling’. Only used when solver=’sgd’.\n",
    "\n",
    "- max_iter : default 200\n",
    "    - Maximum number of iterations. The solver iterates until convergence (determined by ‘tol’) or this number of iterations. For stochastic solvers (‘sgd’, ‘adam’), note that this determines the number of epochs (how many times each data point will be used), not the number of gradient steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- shuffle : default True\n",
    "    - Whether to shuffle samples in each iteration. Only used when solver=’sgd’ or ‘adam’.\n",
    "\n",
    "- random_state : default None\n",
    "    - If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by np.random.\n",
    "\n",
    "- tol : default 1e-4\n",
    "    - Tolerance for the optimization. When the loss or score is not improving by at least tol for two consecutive iterations, unless learning_rate is set to ‘adaptive’, convergence is considered to be reached and training stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- verbose : default False\n",
    "    - Whether to print progress messages to stdout.\n",
    "\n",
    "- warm_start : default False\n",
    "    - When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- momentum : default 0.9\n",
    "    - Momentum for gradient descent update. Should be between 0 and 1. Only used when solver=’sgd’.\n",
    "\n",
    "- nesterovs_momentum : default True\n",
    "    - Whether to use Nesterov’s momentum. Only used when solver=’sgd’ and momentum > 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- early_stopping : default False\n",
    "    - Whether to use early stopping to terminate training when validation score is not improving. If set to true, it will automatically set aside 10% of training data as validation and terminate training when validation score is not improving by at least tol for two consecutive epochs. Only effective when solver=’sgd’ or ‘adam’\n",
    "\n",
    "- validation_fraction : default 0.1\n",
    "    - The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1. Only used if early_stopping is True\n",
    "\n",
    "- beta_1 : default 0.9\n",
    "    - Exponential decay rate for estimates of first moment vector in adam, should be in [0, 1). Only used when solver=’adam’\n",
    "\n",
    "- beta_2 : default 0.999\n",
    "    - Exponential decay rate for estimates of second moment vector in adam, should be in [0, 1). Only used when solver=’adam’\n",

    "### Parameter Search\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for the best hyper-parameters for your algorithm and data, grid search cross validation is commonly used. Alternatively, there is a randomized search approach and this is often preferred for deep learning (working with neural networks with many layers). The [scikit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) provides more thorough information on how to use these. "
